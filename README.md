# Functional differential geometry in Julia

Features:

* Support for finite and infinite dimensional manifolds, including:
  * euclidean space,
  * unit sphere,
  * special orthogonal space,
  * product manifolds,
  * power manifolds,
  * tangent spaces and tangent bundles,
  * spaces of curves on manifolds.
* Optimisation of real-valued functions on manifolds (inspired by Manopt and Pymanopt).
* Differentiation of manifold-valued curves, including support for automatic differentiation.

Planned features:

* More manifolds.
* More transformations of manifolds.
* Group actions on manifolds and quotient spaces.
* More algorithms for optimisation of real-valued functions on manifolds.
* Better support for statistical methods on manifolds.
* Embedding of categorical features.
* Sum manifolds (for, among other things, missing data).
* Square-root velocity function transformation (SRVF), including transported SRVF for curves on general manifolds.
