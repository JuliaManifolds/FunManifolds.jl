# FunManifolds.jl

Functional differential geometry in Julia

Features:

* Expands upon the [`Manifolds.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaManifolds/Manifolds.jl) ecosystem.
* Support for infinite dimensional manifolds, including
  * spaces of curves on manifolds.
* Differentiation of manifold-valued curves, including support for automatic differentiation.

Planned features:

* More manifolds.
* More transformations.
* Square-root velocity function transformation (SRVF), including transported SRVF for curves on general manifolds.
