Features:

- Support for finite and infinite dimensional manifolds, including:
  - euclidean space,
  - unit sphere,
  - special orthogonal space,
  - product manifolds,
  - power manifolds,
  - tangent spaces and tangent bundles,
  - spaces of continuous curves on manifolds.
- Optimisation of real-valued functions on manifolds (inspired by Manopt and Pymanopt).
